## CubeDataType options are: 'float32', 'uint16', or 'uint8'
##   float32 gives better precision for lots of LEs
##   uint8 saves disk space -- and is OK for about 1000 LEs
##   uint16 is a mid-point -- probably good to 10,000 LEs or so

#    file_name is a string
#    allowed_gap_length is in hours. It indicates how long a gap in the time
#         series records you will allow GNOME to interpolate over.
#    type is a string describing the type of the time series file. Options
#         are: "Wind", "Hyd" for Wind or hydrology type files
